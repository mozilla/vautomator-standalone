# vautomator-standalone
Iterative automation of common VA tasks using OOP.

If you'd like to contribute, please reach out to [me](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Cag/) and I'd be happy to add you as a contributor.

## Install & Running 

1. First, download the repo: `git clone https://github.com/caggle/vautomator-standalone.git && cd vautomator-standalone`
2. Build the Docker image: `make build`
3. Run it!: `make scan TARGET=example.net`
4. You can review tool results in the ./results folder while vautomator does it's thing

Example run:
```
$ make scan TARGET=http://192.168.0.1
docker run -v ${PWD}/results:/app/results -it vautomator:latest ./run.py http://192.168.0.1

## What it does

Using **Python 3**, it runs a bunch of tools against a URL/FQDN/IPv4 address on a Docker image of its own, and saves tool outputs for later analysis, as a part of a vulnerability assessment.

### What it actually does

* Determines if the the target is a URL, an IPv4 address or a hostname/FQDN
* If URL *(note: it could be a URL with FQDN or IPv4 address)* it will run:
  * An nmap UDP scan for about 25 selected UDP services
  * An nmap TCP scan for top 1000 services
  * ssh_scan (if an SSH service is identified)
  * A Nessus (Tenable.io) "Basic Network Scan" (provided if you have valid Tenable.io API keys)
  * HTTP Observatory scan
  * TLS Observatory scan
  * Directory bruteforcing against a wordlist
  
* If IP address, it will only run:
  * An nmap UDP scan for about 25 selected UDP services
  * An nmap TCP scan for top 1000 services
  * ssh_scan (if an SSH service is identified)
  * A Nessus (Tenable.io) "Basic Network Scan" (provided if you have valid Tenable.io API keys)
  
In the current implementation these tasks are performed sequentially with the intent being "run and forget" for a couple of hours, while you are doing other important work.

#### Port scans

For TCP and UDP port scans, [python-nmap](https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap/) is used.

##### SSH scan

For SSH scan, [ssh_scan](https://github.com/mozilla/ssh_scan) is used.

#### Nessus scan

Nessus scans will fail unless you have a pair of valid Tenable.io API keys *with administrative permissions*. If you do, populate the .env file with them in the below form building the Docker image:

```
TENABLEIO_ACCESS_KEY=<ACCESS_KEY>
TENABLEIO_SECRET_KEY=<SECRET_KEY>
```

Technically admin permissions is not required to initiate a Tenable.io scan with API. This is required in the code because the tool checks if the target had been scanned in the last 15 days before launching a scan (and that requires admin perms). If it had, then the results are retrieved.
You are OK to not provide API keys if you wish, and the tool will simply not run a Tenable.io scan in that case.

#### Web App scans

If you are running the tool against a URL, a number of additional external tools will be utilised. These will be installed in the Docker container when you build it.
* [observatory](https://github.com/mozilla/observatory-cli) client for HTTP Observatory is used.
* [TLS Observatory](https://github.com/mozilla/tls-observatory), by means of `tlsobs` client.
* For directory brute-forcing:
  * By default, `dirb` will be used with the common wordlist.
  * `gobuster` will also be installed in the Docker container, however a command line switch to use it instead is not available yet (you would have to modify the code).
